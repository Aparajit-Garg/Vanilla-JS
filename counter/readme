Starting with the cool concepts of Javascript, this is a program which contains 2 counters and these counters have been implemented using the concept
of EVENT DELEGATION.

As an event bubbles up, we check the origin element of the event and perform the required task.
Here, there are 6 buttons, but with the help of Event Delegation, I have reduced the implementation of 6 event listeners to just 2 as adding and removing
event listeners comes with an overhead which is not good for the website performance.
